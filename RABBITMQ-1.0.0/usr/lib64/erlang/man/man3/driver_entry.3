.SH NAME
driver_entry \- The driver-entry structure used by erlang drivers.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
As of erts version 5\&.5\&.3 the driver interface has been extended (see \fBextended marker\fR\&)\&. The extended interface introduces \fBversion management\fR\&, the possibility to pass capability flags (see \fBdriver flags\fR\&) to the runtime system at driver initialization, and some new driver API functions\&.
.LP

.RS -4
.B
Note:
.RE
Old drivers (compiled with an \fIerl_driver\&.h\fR\& from an earlier erts version than 5\&.5\&.3) have to be recompiled (but do not have to use the extended interface)\&.

.LP
The \fIdriver_entry\fR\& structure is a C struct that all erlang drivers define\&. It contains entry points for the erlang driver that are called by the erlang emulator when erlang code accesses the driver\&.
.LP
The \fBerl_driver\fR\& driver API functions need a port handle that identifies the driver instance (and the port in the emulator)\&. This is only passed to the \fIstart\fR\& function, but not to the other functions\&. The \fIstart\fR\& function returns a driver-defined handle that is passed to the other functions\&. A common practice is to have the \fIstart\fR\& function allocate some application-defined structure and stash the \fIport\fR\& handle in it, to use it later with the driver API functions\&.
.LP
The driver call-back functions are called synchronously from the erlang emulator\&. If they take too long before completing, they can cause timeouts in the emulator\&. Use the queue or asynchronous calls if necessary, since the emulator must be responsive\&.
.LP
The driver structure contains the name of the driver and some 15 function pointers\&. These pointers are called at different times by the emulator\&.
.LP
The only exported function from the driver is \fIdriver_init\fR\&\&. This function returns the \fIdriver_entry\fR\& structure that points to the other functions in the driver\&. The \fIdriver_init\fR\& function is declared with a macro \fIDRIVER_INIT(drivername)\fR\&\&. (This is because different OS\&'s have different names for it\&.)
.LP
When writing a driver in C++, the driver entry should be of \fI"C"\fR\& linkage\&. One way to do this is to put this line somewhere before the driver entry: \fIextern "C" DRIVER_INIT(drivername);\fR\&\&.
.LP
When the driver has passed the \fIdriver_entry\fR\& over to the emulator, the driver is \fInot\fR\& allowed to modify the \fIdriver_entry\fR\&\&.
.LP

.RS -4
.B
Note:
.RE
Do \fInot\fR\& declare the \fIdriver_entry\fR\&\fIconst\fR\&\&. This since the emulator needs to modify the \fIhandle\fR\&, and the \fIhandle2\fR\& fields\&. A statically allocated, and \fIconst\fR\& declared \fIdriver_entry\fR\& may be located in read only memory which will cause the emulator to crash\&.

This is called directly after the driver has been loaded by \fIerl_ddll:load_driver/2\fR\&\&. (Actually when the driver is added to the driver list\&.) The driver should return 0, or if the driver can\&'t initialize, -1\&.

ErlDrvData (*start)(ErlDrvPort port, char* command):
This is called when the driver is instantiated, when \fIopen_port/2\fR\& is called\&. The driver should return a number >= 0 or a pointer, or if the driver can\&'t be started, one of three error codes should be returned:

void (*stop)(ErlDrvData drv_data):
This is called when the port is closed, with \fIport_close/1\fR\& or \fIPort ! {self(), close}\fR\&\&. Note that terminating the port owner process also closes the port\&. If \fIdrv_data\fR\& is a pointer to memory allocated in \fIstart\fR\&, then \fIstop\fR\& is the place to deallocate that memory\&.
.TP 2

void (*output)(ErlDrvData drv_data, char *buf, int len):
This is called when an erlang process has sent data to the port\&. The data is pointed to by \fIbuf\fR\&, and is \fIlen\fR\& bytes\&. Data is sent to the port with \fIPort ! {self(), {command, Data}}\fR\&, or with \fIport_command/2\fR\&\&. Depending on how the port was opened, it should be either a list of integers 0\&.\&.\&.255 or a binary\&. See \fIopen_port/3\fR\& and \fIport_command/2\fR\&\&.

void (*ready_output)(ErlDrvData drv_data, ErlDrvEvent event):
This is called when a driver event (given in the \fIevent\fR\& parameter) is signaled\&. This is used to help asynchronous drivers "wake up" when something happens\&.
.RS 2
.LP
On unix the \fIevent\fR\& is a pipe or socket handle (or something that the \fIselect\fR\& system call understands)\&.
.RE
.RS 2

On Windows the \fIevent\fR\& is an Event or Semaphore (or something that the \fIWaitForMultipleObjects\fR\& API function understands)\&. (Some trickery in the emulator allows more than the built-in limit of 64 \fIEvents\fR\& to be used\&.)
.RE
.RS 2
.LP
To use this with threads and asynchronous routines, create a pipe on unix and an Event on Windows\&. When the routine completes, write to the pipe (use \fISetEvent\fR\& on Windows), this will make the emulator call \fIready_input\fR\& or \fIready_output\fR\&\&.

Spurious events may happen\&. That is, calls to \fIready_input\fR\& or \fIready_output\fR\& even though no real events are signaled\&. In reality it should be rare (and OS dependant), but a robust driver must nevertheless be able to handle such cases\&.

This function is called by the \fIerl_ddll\fR\& driver when the driver is unloaded\&. (It is only called in dynamic drivers\&.)

int (*control)(ErlDrvData drv_data, unsigned int command, char *buf, int len, char **rbuf, int rlen):
This is a special routine invoked with the erlang function \fIport_control/3\fR\&\&. It works a little like an "ioctl" for erlang drivers\&. The data given to \fIport_control/3\fR\& arrives in \fIbuf\fR\& and \fIlen\fR\&\&. The driver may send data back, using \fI*rbuf\fR\& and \fIrlen\fR\&\&.
.RS 2
.LP
This is the fastest way of calling a driver and get a response\&. It won\&'t make any context switch in the erlang emulator, and requires no message passing\&. It is suitable for calling C function to get faster execution, when erlang is too slow\&.
.RE
.RS 2
.LP
If the driver wants to return data, it should return it in \fIrbuf\fR\&\&. When \fIcontrol\fR\& is called, \fI*rbuf\fR\& points to a default buffer of \fIrlen\fR\& bytes, which can be used to return data\&. Data is returned different depending on the port control flags (those that are set with \fBset_port_control_flags\fR\&)\&.
.RE
.RS 2
.LP
If the flag is set to \fIPORT_CONTROL_FLAG_BINARY\fR\&, a binary will be returned\&. Small binaries can be returned by writing the raw data into the default buffer\&. A binary can also be returned by setting \fI*rbuf\fR\& to point to a binary allocated with \fBdriver_alloc_binary\fR\&\&. This binary will be freed automatically after \fIcontrol\fR\& has returned\&. The driver can retain the binary for \fIread only\fR\& access with \fBdriver_binary_inc_refc\fR\& to be freed later with \fBdriver_free_binary\fR\&\&. It is never allowed to alter the binary after \fIcontrol\fR\& has returned\&. If \fI*rbuf\fR\& is set to NULL, an empty list will be returned\&.
.RE
.RS 2
.LP
If the flag is set to \fI0\fR\&, data is returned as a list of integers\&. Either use the default buffer or set \fI*rbuf\fR\& to point to a larger buffer allocated with \fBdriver_alloc\fR\&\&. The buffer will be freed automatically after \fIcontrol\fR\& has returned\&.

void (*timeout)(ErlDrvData drv_data):
This function is called any time after the driver\&'s timer reaches 0\&. The timer is activated with \fIdriver_set_timer\fR\&\&. There are no priorities or ordering among drivers, so if several drivers time out at the same time, any one of them is called first\&.
.TP 2

void (*outputv)(ErlDrvData drv_data, ErlIOVec *ev):
This function is called whenever the port is written to\&. If it is \fINULL\fR\&, the \fIoutput\fR\& function is called instead\&. This function is faster than \fIoutput\fR\&, because it takes an \fIErlIOVec\fR\& directly, which requires no copying of the data\&. The port should be in binary mode, see \fIopen_port/2\fR\&\&.
.RS 2
.LP
The \fIErlIOVec\fR\& contains both a \fISysIOVec\fR\&, suitable for \fIwritev\fR\&, and one or more binaries\&. If these binaries should be retained, when the driver returns from \fIoutputv\fR\&, they can be queued (using \fBdriver_enq_bin\fR\& for instance), or if they are kept in a static or global variable, the reference counter can be incremented\&.

void (*ready_async)(ErlDrvData drv_data, ErlDrvThreadData thread_data):

.LP
\fIrbuf\fR\& points to a return buffer, \fIrlen\fR\& bytes long\&. The return data should be a valid erlang term in the external (binary) format\&. This is converted to an erlang term and returned by \fIerlang:port_call/3\fR\& to the caller\&. If more space than \fIrlen\fR\& bytes is needed to return data, \fI*rbuf\fR\& can be set to memory allocated with \fIdriver_alloc\fR\&\&. This memory will be freed automatically after \fIcall\fR\& has returned\&.

The return value is the number of bytes returned in \fI*rbuf\fR\&\&. If \fIERL_DRV_ERROR_GENERAL\fR\& is returned (or in fact, anything < 0), \fIerlang:port_call/3\fR\& will throw a \fIBAD_ARG\fR\&\&.
