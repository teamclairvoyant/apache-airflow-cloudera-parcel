igor \- Igor: the Module Merger and Renamer.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
Igor: the Module Merger and Renamer\&.
.LP
The program Igor merges the source code of one or more Erlang modules into a single module, which can then replace the original set of modules\&. Igor is also able to rename a set of (possibly interdependent) modules, without joining them into a single module\&.
.LP
The main user interface consists of the functions \fBmerge/3\fR\& and \fBrename/3\fR\&\&. See also the function \fBparse_transform/2\fR\&\&.
.LP
A note of warning: Igor cannot do anything about the case when the name of a remote function is passed to the built-in functions \fIapply\fR\& and \fIspawn\fR\& \fIunless\fR\& the module and function names are explicitly stated in the call, as in e\&.g\&. \fIapply(lists, reverse, [Xs])\fR\&\&. In all other cases, Igor leaves such calls unchanged, and warns the user that manual editing might be necessary\&.
.LP
Also note that Erlang records will be renamed as necessary to avoid non-equivalent definitions using the same record name\&. This does not work if the source code accesses the name field of such record tuples by \fIelement/2\fR\& or similar methods\&. Always use the record syntax to handle record tuples, if possible\&.
.LP
Disclaimer: the author of this program takes no responsibility for the correctness of the produced output, or for any effects of its execution\&. In particular, the author may not be held responsible should Igor include the code of a deceased madman in the result\&.
.LP

A stub module descriptor contains the module name, a list of exported functions, and a list of module attributes\&. Each function is described by its name (which includes its arity), and the corresponding module and function that it calls\&. (The arities should always match\&.)

Merges source code files to a single file\&. \fIName\fR\& specifies the name of the resulting module - not the name of the output file\&. \fIFiles\fR\& is a list of file names and/or module names of source modules to be read and merged (see \fImerge_files/4\fR\& for details)\&.

given a module \fIm\fR\& in file "\fIm\&.erl\fR\&" which uses the standard library module \fIlists\fR\&, calling \fIigor:merge(m, [m, lists])\fR\& will create a new file "\fIm\&.erl\fR\& which contains the code from \fIm\fR\& and exports the same functions, and which includes the referenced code from the \fIlists\fR\& module\&. The original file will be renamed to "\fIm\&.erl\&.bak\fR\&"\&.
.LP
.TP 2

given modules \fIm1\fR\& and \fIm2\fR\&, in corresponding files, calling \fIigor:merge(m, [m1, m2])\fR\& will create a file "\fIm\&.erl\fR\&" which contains the code from \fIm1\fR\& and \fIm2\fR\& and exports the functions of \fIm1\fR\&\&.

.LP
Stub module files are created for those modules that are to be exported by the target module (see options \fIexport\fR\&, \fIstubs\fR\& and \fIstub_dir\fR\&)\&.
.LP
The function returns the list of file names of all created modules, including any automatically created stub modules\&. The file name of the target module is always first in the list\&.
.LP
Note: If you get a "syntax error" message when trying to merge files (and you know those files to be correct), then try the \fIpreprocess\fR\& option\&. It typically means that your code contains too strange macros to be handled without actually performing the preprocessor expansions\&.

Merges source code files and syntax trees to a single syntax tree\&. This is a file-reading front end to \fImerge_sources/3\fR\&\&. \fIName\fR\& specifies the name of the resulting module - not the name of the output file\&. \fISources\fR\& is a list of syntax trees and/or lists of "source code form" syntax trees, each entry representing a module definition\&. \fIFiles\fR\& is a list of file names and/or module names of source modules to be read and included\&. All the input modules must be distinctly named\&.
.LP
If a name in \fIFiles\fR\& is not the name of an existing file, Igor assumes it represents a module name, and tries to locate and read the corresponding source file\&. The parsed files are appended to \fISources\fR\& and passed on to \fImerge_sources/3\fR\&, i\&.e\&., entries in \fISources\fR\& are listed before entries read from files\&.
.LP
If no exports are listed by an \fIexport\fR\& option (see \fImerge_sources/3\fR\& for details), then if \fIName\fR\& is also the name of one of the input modules, that module will be exported; otherwise, the first listed module will be exported\&. Cf\&. the examples under \fImerge/3\fR\&\&.
.LP
The result is a pair \fI{Tree, Stubs}\fR\&, where \fITree\fR\& represents the source code that is the result of merging all the code in \fISources\fR\& and \fIFiles\fR\&, and \fIStubs\fR\& is a list of stub module descriptors (see \fImerge_sources/3\fR\& for details)\&.

\fI{find_src_rules, [{string(), string()}]}\fR\&:

\fI{macros, [{atom(), term()}]}\fR\&:

.TP 2
.B
\fI{preprocess, boolean()}\fR\&:
If the value is \fIfalse\fR\&, Igor will read source files without passing them through the Erlang preprocessor (\fIepp\fR\&), in order to avoid expansion of preprocessor directives such as \fI-include(\&.\&.\&.)\&.\fR\&, \fI-define(\&.\&.\&.)\&.\fR\& and \fI-ifdef(\&.\&.\&.)\fR\&, and macro calls such as \fI?LINE\fR\& and \fI?MY_MACRO(x, y)\fR\&\&. The default value is \fIfalse\fR\&, i\&.e\&., preprocessing is not done\&. (See the module \fIepp_dodger\fR\& for details\&.)
.RS 2
.LP
Notes: If a file contains too exotic definitions or uses of macros, it will not be possible to read it without preprocessing\&. Furthermore, Igor does not currently try to sort out multiple inclusions of the same file, or redefinitions of the same macro name\&. Therefore, when preprocessing is turned off, it may become necessary to edit the resulting source code, removing such re-inclusions and redefinitions\&.

Note: The distinction between "static" and "safe" modules is necessary in order not to break the semantics of dynamic code replacement\&. A "static" source module will not be replaced unless the target module also is\&. Now imagine a state machine implemented by placing the code for each state in a separate module, and suppose that we want to merge this into a single target module, marking all source modules as static\&. At each point in the original code where a call is made from one of the modules to another (i\&.e\&., the state transitions), code replacement is expected to be detected\&. Then, if we in the merged code do not check at these points if the \fItarget\fR\& module (the result of the merge) has been replaced, we can not be sure in general that we will be able to do code replacement of the merged state machine - it could run forever without detecting the code change\&. Therefore, all such calls must remain remote-calls (detecting code changes), but may call the target module directly\&.
.LP
If we are sure that this kind of situation cannot ensue, we may specify the involved modules as "safe", and all calls between them will become local\&. Note that if the target module itself is specified as safe, "remote" calls to itself will be turned into local calls\&. This would destroy the code replacement properties of e\&.g\&. a typical server loop\&.
