.SH NAME
alarm_handler \- An Alarm Handling Process
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The alarm handler process is a \fIgen_event\fR\& event manager process which receives alarms in the system\&. This process is not intended to be a complete alarm handler\&. It defines a place to which alarms can be sent\&. One simple event handler is installed in the alarm handler at start-up, but users are encouraged to write and install their own handlers\&.
.LP
The simple event handler sends all alarms as info reports to the error logger, and saves all of them in a list which can be passed to a user defined event handler, which may be installed at a later stage\&. The list can grow large if many alarms are generated\&. So it is a good reason to install a better user defined handler\&.
.LP
There are functions to set and clear alarms\&. The format of alarms are defined by the user\&. For example, an event handler for SNMP could be defined, together with an alarm MIB\&.
.LP
The alarm handler is part of the SASL application\&.
.LP
When writing new event handlers for the alarm handler, the following events must be handled:
.RS 2
.TP 2
.B
\fI{set_alarm, {AlarmId, AlarmDescr}}\fR\&:
This event is generated by \fIalarm_handler:set_alarm({AlarmId, AlarmDecsr})\fR\&\&.
.TP 2
.B
\fI{clear_alarm, AlarmId}\fR\&:
This event is generated by \fIalarm_handler:clear_alarm(AlarmId)\fR\&\&.
.RE
.LP
The default simple handler is called \fIalarm_handler\fR\& and it may be exchanged by calling \fIgen_event:swap_handler/3\fR\& as \fIgen_event:swap_handler(alarm_handler, {alarm_handler, swap}, {NewHandler, Args})\fR\&\&. \fINewHandler:init({Args, {alarm_handler, Alarms}})\fR\& is called\&. Refer to gen_event(3) for further details\&.
