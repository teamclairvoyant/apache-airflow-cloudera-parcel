.TH CosEventChannelAdmin_ProxyPullConsumer 3 "cosEvent 2.1.11" "Ericsson AB" "Erlang Module Definition"
.SH NAME
CosEventChannelAdmin_ProxyPullConsumer \- This module implements a ProxyPullConsumer interface which acts as a middleman between pull supplier and the event channel.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The ProxyPullConsumer interface defines the second step for connecting pull suppliers to the event channel\&. A proxy consumer is similar to a normal consumer, but includes an additional method for connecting a supplier to the proxy consumer\&.
.LP
To get access to all definitions, e\&.g\&., exceptions, include necessary \fIhrl\fR\& files by using:
.br
\fI-include_lib("cosEvent/include/*\&.hrl")\&.\fR\&
.LP
Any object that possesses an object reference that supports the ProxyPullConsumer interface can perform the following operations:

connect_pull_supplier(Object, PullSupplier) -> Return

.TP 3
Types:

Object = #objref
.br
PullSupplier = #objref of PullSupplier type
.br
Return = ok | {'EXCEPTION', E}
.br
E = #'CosEventChannelAdmin_AlreadyConnected'{} | #'CosEventChannelAdmin_TypeError'{}

.LP
This operation connects PullSupplier object to the ProxyPullConsumer object\&. If a nil object reference is passed CORBA standard \fIBAD_PARAM\fR\& exception is raised\&. If the ProxyPullConsumer is already connected to a PullSupplier, then the \fICosEventChannelAdmin_AlreadyConnected\fR\& exception is raised\&. Implementations of ProxyPullConsumers may require additional interface functionality; if these requirements are not met the \fICosEventChannelAdmin_TypeError\fR\& exception will be raised\&.

This operation disconnects proxy pull consumer from the event channel and sends a notification about the loss of the connection to the pull supplier attached to it\&.
