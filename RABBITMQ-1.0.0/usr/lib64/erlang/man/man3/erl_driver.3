erl_driver \- API functions for an Erlang driver
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
As of erts version 5\&.5\&.3 the driver interface has been extended (see \fBextended marker\fR\&)\&. The extended interface introduce \fBversion management\fR\&, the possibility to pass capability flags (see \fBdriver flags\fR\&) to the runtime system at driver initialization, and some new driver API functions\&.
.LP

.RS -4
.B
Note:
.RE
Old drivers (compiled with an \fIerl_driver\&.h\fR\& from an earlier erts version than 5\&.5\&.3) have to be recompiled (but does not have to use the extended interface)\&.

.LP
The driver calls back to the emulator, using the API functions declared in \fIerl_driver\&.h\fR\&\&. They are used for outputting data from the driver, using timers, etc\&.
.LP
A driver is a library with a set of function that the emulator calls, in response to Erlang functions and message sending\&. There may be multiple instances of a driver, each instance is connected to an Erlang port\&. Every port has a port owner process\&. Communication with the port is normally done through the port owner process\&.
.LP
Most of the functions take the \fIport\fR\& handle as an argument\&. This identifies the driver instance\&. Note that this port handle must be stored by the driver, it is not given when the driver is called from the emulator (see \fBdriver_entry\fR\&)\&.
.LP
Some of the functions take a parameter of type \fIErlDrvBinary\fR\&, a driver binary\&. It should be both allocated and freed by the caller\&. Using a binary directly avoids one extra copying of data\&.
.LP
Many of the output functions have a "header buffer", with \fIhbuf\fR\& and \fIhlen\fR\& parameters\&. This buffer is sent as a list before the binary (or list, depending on port mode) that is sent\&. This is convenient when matching on messages received from the port\&. (Although in the latest versions of Erlang, there is the binary syntax, that enables you to match on the beginning of a binary\&.) 
.LP
In the runtime system with SMP support, drivers are locked either on driver level or port level (driver instance level)\&. By default driver level locking will be used, i\&.e\&., only one emulator thread will execute code in the driver at a time\&. If port level locking is used, multiple emulator threads may execute code in the driver at the same time\&. There will only be one thread at a time calling driver call-backs corresponding to the same port, though\&. In order to enable port level locking set the \fIERL_DRV_FLAG_USE_PORT_LOCKING\fR\& \fBdriver flag\fR\& in the \fBdriver_entry\fR\& used by the driver\&. When port level locking is used it is the responsibility of the driver writer to synchronize all accesses to data shared by the ports (driver instances)\&.
.LP
Most drivers written before the runtime system with SMP support existed will be able to run in the runtime system with SMP support without being rewritten if driver level locking is used\&.
.LP

.RS -4
.B
Note:
.RE
It is assumed that drivers do not access other drivers\&. If drivers should access each other they have to provide their own mechanism for thread safe synchronization\&. Such "inter driver communication" is strongly discouraged\&.

.LP
Previously, in the runtime system without SMP support, specific driver call-backs were always called from the same thread\&. This is \fInot\fR\& the case in the runtime system with SMP support\&. Regardless of locking scheme used, calls to driver call-backs may be made from different threads, e\&.g\&., two consecutive calls to exactly the same call-back for exactly the same port may be made from two different threads\&. This will for \fImost\fR\& drivers not be a problem, but it might\&. Drivers that depend on all call-backs being called in the same thread, \fIhave\fR\& to be rewritten before being used in the runtime system with SMP support\&.
.LP

.RS -4
.B
Note:
.RE
Regardless of locking scheme used, calls to driver call-backs may be made from different threads\&.

.LP
Most functions in this API are \fInot\fR\& thread-safe, i\&.e\&., they may \fInot\fR\& be called from an arbitrary thread\&. Functions that are not documented as thread-safe may only be called from driver call-backs or function calls descending from a driver call-back call\&. Note that driver call-backs may be called from different threads\&. This, however, is not a problem for any function in this API, since the emulator has control over these threads\&.
.LP

.RS -4
.B
Note:
.RE
Functions not explicitly documented as thread-safe are \fInot\fR\& thread-safe\&. Also note that some functions are \fIonly\fR\& thread safe when used in a runtime system with SMP support\&.

.SH "FUNCTIONALITY"

.LP
All functions that a driver needs to do with Erlang are performed through driver API functions\&. There are functions for the following functionality:
.RS 2
.TP 2
.B
Timer functions:
Timer functions are used to control the timer that a driver may use\&. The timer will have the emulator call the \fBtimeout\fR\& entry function after a specified time\&. Only one timer is available for each driver instance\&.
.TP 2
.B
Queue handling:
Every driver instance has an associated queue\&. This queue is a \fISysIOVec\fR\& that works as a buffer\&. It\&'s mostly used for the driver to buffer data that should be written to a device, it is a byte stream\&. If the port owner process closes the driver, and the queue is not empty, the driver will not be closed\&. This enables the driver to flush its buffers before closing\&.
.RS 2
.LP
The queue can be manipulated from arbitrary threads if a port data lock is used\&. See documentation of the \fBErlDrvPDL\fR\& type for more information\&.
.RE
.TP 2
.B
Output functions:
With the output functions, the driver sends data back to the emulator\&. They will be received as messages by the port owner process, see \fIopen_port/2\fR\&\&. The vector function and the function taking a driver binary are faster, because they avoid copying the data buffer\&. There is also a fast way of sending terms from the driver, without going through the binary term format\&.
.TP 2
.B
Failure:
The driver can exit and signal errors up to Erlang\&. This is only for severe errors, when the driver can\&'t possibly keep open\&.
.TP 2
.B
Asynchronous calls:
The latest Erlang versions (R7B and later) has provision for asynchronous function calls, using a thread pool provided by Erlang\&. There is also a select call, that can be used for asynchronous drivers\&.
.TP 2
.B
\fBMulti-threading\fR\&:
A POSIX thread like API for multi-threading is provided\&. The Erlang driver thread API only provide a subset of the functionality provided by the POSIX thread API\&. The subset provided is more or less the basic functionality needed for multi-threaded programming:

The Erlang driver thread API can be used in conjunction with the POSIX thread API on UN-ices and with the Windows native thread API on Windows\&. The Erlang driver thread API has the advantage of being portable, but there might exist situations where you want to use functionality from the POSIX thread API or the Windows native thread API\&.
.RE
.RS 2
.LP
The Erlang driver thread API only returns error codes when it is reasonable to recover from an error condition\&. If it isn\&'t reasonable to recover from an error condition, the whole runtime system is terminated\&. For example, if a create mutex operation fails, an error code is returned, but if a lock operation on a mutex fails, the whole runtime system is terminated\&.
.RE
.RS 2
.LP
Note that there exists no "condition variable wait with timeout" in the Erlang driver thread API\&. This is due to issues with \fIpthread_cond_timedwait()\fR\&\&. When the system clock suddenly is changed, it isn\&'t always guaranteed that you will wake up from the call as expected\&. An Erlang runtime system has to be able to cope with sudden changes of the system clock\&. Therefore, we have omitted it from the Erlang driver thread API\&. In the Erlang driver case, timeouts can and should be handled with the timer functionality of the Erlang driver API\&.
.RE
.RS 2
.LP
In order for the Erlang driver thread API to function, thread support has to be enabled in the runtime system\&. An Erlang driver can check if thread support is enabled by use of \fBdriver_system_info()\fR\&\&. Note that some functions in the Erlang driver API are thread-safe only when the runtime system has SMP support, also this information can be retrieved via \fBdriver_system_info()\fR\&\&. Also note that a lot of functions in the Erlang driver API are \fInot\fR\& thread-safe regardless of whether SMP support is enabled or not\&. If a function isn\&'t documented as thread-safe it is \fInot\fR\& thread-safe\&.
.RE
.RS 2
.LP
\fINOTE\fR\&: When executing in an emulator thread, it is \fIvery important\fR\& that you unlock \fIall\fR\& locks you have locked before letting the thread out of your control; otherwise, you are \fIvery likely\fR\& to deadlock the whole emulator\&. If you need to use thread specific data in an emulator thread, only have the thread specific data set while the thread is under your control, and clear the thread specific data before you let the thread out of your control\&.
.RE
.RS 2
.LP
In the future there will probably be debug functionality integrated with the Erlang driver thread API\&. All functions that create entities take a \fIname\fR\& argument\&. Currently the \fIname\fR\& argument is unused, but it will be used when the debug functionality has been implemented\&. If you name all entities created well, the debug functionality will be able to give you better error reports\&.
.RE
.TP 2
.B
Adding / removing drivers:
A driver can add and later remove drivers\&.
.TP 2
.B
Monitoring processes:
A driver can monitor a process that does not own a port\&.
.TP 2
.B
\fBVersion management\fR\&:
Version management is enabled for drivers that have set the \fBextended_marker\fR\& field of their \fBdriver_entry\fR\& to \fIERL_DRV_EXTENDED_MARKER\fR\&\&. \fIerl_driver\&.h\fR\& defines \fIERL_DRV_EXTENDED_MARKER\fR\&, \fIERL_DRV_EXTENDED_MAJOR_VERSION\fR\&, and \fIERL_DRV_EXTENDED_MINOR_VERSION\fR\&\&. \fIERL_DRV_EXTENDED_MAJOR_VERSION\fR\& will be incremented when driver incompatible changes are made to the Erlang runtime system\&. Normally it will suffice to recompile drivers when the \fIERL_DRV_EXTENDED_MAJOR_VERSION\fR\& has changed, but it could, under rare circumstances, mean that drivers have to be slightly modified\&. If so, this will of course be documented\&. \fIERL_DRV_EXTENDED_MINOR_VERSION\fR\& will be incremented when new features are added\&. The runtime system uses the minor version of the driver to determine what features to use\&. The runtime system will refuse to load a driver if the major versions differ, or if the major versions are equal and the minor version used by the driver is greater than the one used by the runtime system\&.
.RS 2
.LP
The emulator tries to check that a driver that doesn\&'t use the extended driver interface isn\&'t incompatible when loading it\&. It can, however, not make sure that it isn\&'t incompatible\&. Therefore, when loading a driver that doesn\&'t use the extended driver interface, there is a risk that it will be loaded also when the driver is incompatible\&. When the driver uses the extended driver interface, the emulator can verify that it isn\&'t of an incompatible driver version\&. You are therefore advised to use the extended driver interface\&.

A port data lock is reference counted, and when the reference count reaches zero, it will be destroyed\&.

The term \fIERL_DRV_STRING_CONS\fR\& is a way to construct strings\&.

If you want to pass a binary and don\&'t already have the content of the binary in an \fIErlDrvBinary\fR\&, you can benefit from using \fIERL_DRV_BUF2BINARY\fR\& instead of creating an \fIErlDrvBinary\fR\& via \fIdriver_alloc_binary()\fR\& and then pass the binary via \fIERL_DRV_BINARY\fR\&\&. The runtime system will often allocate binaries smarter if \fIERL_DRV_BUF2BINARY\fR\& is used\&.

.br
.RS
.LP
This function performs an asynchronous call\&. The function \fIasync_invoke\fR\& is invoked in a thread separate from the emulator thread\&. This enables the driver to perform time-consuming, blocking operations without blocking the emulator\&.
.LP
Erlang is by default started without an async thread pool\&. The number of async threads that the runtime system should use is specified by the \fB+A\fR\& command line argument of \fBerl(1)\fR\&\&. If no async thread pool is available, the call is made synchronously in the thread calling \fIdriver_async()\fR\&\&. The current number of async threads in the async thread pool can be retrieved via \fBdriver_system_info()\fR\&\&.
.LP
If there is a thread pool available, a thread will be used\&. If the \fIkey\fR\& argument is null, the threads from the pool are used in a round-robin way, each call to \fIdriver_async\fR\& uses the next thread in the pool\&. With the \fIkey\fR\& argument set, this behaviour is changed\&. The two same values of \fI*key\fR\& always get the same thread\&.
.LP
To make sure that a driver instance always uses the same thread, the following call can be used:
.LP

.LP
.nf

    unsigned int myKey = (unsigned int) myPort;

    r = driver_async(myPort, &myKey, myData, myFunc);
        
.fi
.LP
It is enough to initialize \fImyKey\fR\& once for each driver instance\&.
.LP
If a thread is already working, the calls will be queued up and executed in order\&. Using the same thread for each driver instance ensures that the calls will be made in sequence\&.
.LP
The \fIasync_data\fR\& is the argument to the functions \fIasync_invoke\fR\& and \fIasync_free\fR\&\&. It\&'s typically a pointer to a structure that contains a pipe or event that can be used to signal that the async operation completed\&. The data should be freed in \fIasync_free\fR\&, because it\&'s called if \fIdriver_async_cancel\fR\& is called\&.
.LP
When the async operation is done, \fBready_async\fR\& driver entry function is called\&. If \fIasync_ready\fR\& is null in the driver entry, the \fIasync_free\fR\& function is called instead\&.

The return value is a handle to the asynchronous task, which can be used as argument to \fIdriver_async_cancel\fR\&\&.

As of erts version 5\&.5\&.4\&.3 the default stack size for threads in the async-thread pool is 16 kilowords, i\&.e\&., 64 kilobyte on 32-bit architectures\&. This small default size has been chosen since the amount of async-threads might be quite large\&. The default stack size is enough for drivers delivered with Erlang/OTP, but might not be sufficiently large for other dynamically linked in drivers that use the driver_async() functionality\&.

This function retrieves the value of an environment variable\&. When called, \fI*value_size\fR\& should contain the size of the \fIvalue\fR\& buffer\&. On success \fI0\fR\& is returned, the value of the environment variable has been written to the \fIvalue\fR\& buffer, and \fI*value_size\fR\& contains the string length (excluding the terminating null character) of the value written to the \fIvalue\fR\& buffer\&. On failure, i\&.e\&., no such environment variable was found, a value less than \fI0\fR\& is returned\&. When the size of the \fIvalue\fR\& buffer is too small, a value greater than \fI0\fR\& is returned and \fI*value_size\fR\& has been set to the buffer size needed\&.
