.SH NAME
ets \- Built-In Term Storage
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
This module is an interface to the Erlang built-in term storage BIFs\&. These provide the ability to store very large quantities of data in an Erlang runtime system, and to have constant access time to the data\&. (In the case of \fIordered_set\fR\&, see below, access time is proportional to the logarithm of the number of objects stored)\&.
.LP
Data is organized as a set of dynamic tables, which can store tuples\&. Each table is created by a process\&. When the process terminates, the table is automatically destroyed\&. Every table has access rights set at creation\&.
.LP
Tables are divided into four different types, \fIset\fR\&, \fIordered_set\fR\&, \fIbag\fR\& and \fIduplicate_bag\fR\&\&. A \fIset\fR\& or \fIordered_set\fR\& table can only have one object associated with each key\&. A \fIbag\fR\& or \fIduplicate_bag\fR\& can have many objects associated with each key\&.
.LP
The number of tables stored at one Erlang node is limited\&. The current default limit is approximately 1400 tables\&. The upper limit can be increased by setting the environment variable \fIERL_MAX_ETS_TABLES\fR\& before starting the Erlang runtime system (i\&.e\&. with the \fI-env\fR\& option to \fIerl\fR\&/\fIwerl\fR\&)\&. The actual limit may be slightly higher than the one specified, but never lower\&.
.LP
Note that there is no automatic garbage collection for tables\&. Even if there are no references to a table from any process, it will not automatically be destroyed unless the owner process terminates\&. It can be destroyed explicitly by using \fIdelete/1\fR\&\&. The default owner is the process that created the table\&. Table ownership can be transferred at process termination by using the \fBheir\fR\& option or explicitly by calling \fBgive_away/3\fR\&\&.
.LP
Some implementation details:
.RS 2
.TP 2
*
In the current implementation, every object insert and look-up operation results in a copy of the object\&.
.LP
.TP 2
*
\fI\&'$end_of_table\&'\fR\& should not be used as a key since this atom is used to mark the end of the table when using \fIfirst\fR\&/\fInext\fR\&\&.
.LP
.RE

.LP
Also worth noting is the subtle difference between \fImatching\fR\& and \fIcomparing equal\fR\&, which is demonstrated by the different table types \fIset\fR\& and \fIordered_set\fR\&\&. Two Erlang terms \fImatch\fR\& if they are of the same type and have the same value, so that \fI1\fR\& matches \fI1\fR\&, but not \fI1\&.0\fR\& (as \fI1\&.0\fR\& is a \fIfloat()\fR\& and not an \fIinteger()\fR\&)\&. Two Erlang terms \fIcompare equal\fR\& if they either are of the same type and value, or if both are numeric types and extend to the same value, so that \fI1\fR\& compares equal to both \fI1\fR\& and \fI1\&.0\fR\&\&. The \fIordered_set\fR\& works on the \fIErlang term order\fR\& and there is no defined order between an \fIinteger()\fR\& and a \fIfloat()\fR\& that extends to the same value, hence the key \fI1\fR\& and the key \fI1\&.0\fR\& are regarded as equal in an \fIordered_set\fR\& table\&.
.SH "FAILURE"

.LP
In general, the functions below will exit with reason \fIbadarg\fR\& if any argument is of the wrong format, if the table identifier is invalid or if the operation is denied due to table access rights (\fBprotected\fR\& or \fBprivate\fR\&)\&.
.SH "CONCURRENCY"

.LP
This module provides some limited support for concurrent access\&. All updates to single objects are guaranteed to be both \fIatomic\fR\& and \fIisolated\fR\&\&. This means that an updating operation towards a single object will either succeed or fail completely without any effect at all (atomicy)\&. Nor can any intermediate results of the update be seen by other processes (isolation)\&. Some functions that update several objects state that they even guarantee atomicy and isolation for the entire operation\&. In database terms the isolation level can be seen as "serializable", as if all isolated operations were carried out serially, one after the other in a strict order\&.
.LP
No other support is available within ETS that would guarantee consistency between objects\&. However, the \fIsafe_fixtable/2\fR\& function can be used to guarantee that a sequence of \fIfirst/1\fR\& and \fInext/2\fR\& calls will traverse the table without errors and that each existing object in the table is visited exactly once, even if another process (or the same process) simultaneously deletes or inserts objects into the table\&. Nothing more is guaranteed; in particular objects that are inserted or deleted during such a traversal may be visited once or not at all\&. Functions that internally traverse over a table, like \fIselect\fR\& and \fImatch\fR\&, will give the same guarantee as \fIsafe_fixtable\fR\&\&.
.SH "MATCH SPECIFICATIONS"

.LP
Some of the functions uses a \fImatch specification\fR\&, match_spec\&. A brief explanation is given in \fBselect/2\fR\&\&. For a detailed description, see the chapter "Match specifications in Erlang" in \fIERTS User\&'s Guide\fR\&\&.

Reads a file produced by \fBtab2file/2\fR\& or \fBtab2file/3\fR\& and creates the corresponding table \fITab\fR\&\&.
.LP
The currently only supported option is \fI{verify,boolean()}\fR\&\&. If verification is turned on (by means of specifying \fI{verify,true}\fR\&), the function utilizes whatever information is present in the file to assert that the information is not damaged\&. How this is done depends on which \fIextended_info\fR\& was written using \fBtab2file/3\fR\&\&.
.LP
If no \fIextended_info\fR\& is present in the file and \fI{verify,true}\fR\& is specified, the number of objects written is compared to the size of the original table when the dump was started\&. This might make verification fail if the table was \fIpublic\fR\& and objects were added or removed while the table was dumped to file\&. To avoid this type of problems, either do not verify files dumped while updated simultaneously or use the \fI{extended_info, [object_count]}\fR\& option to \fBtab2file/3\fR\&, which extends the information in the file with the number of objects actually written\&.
.LP
If verification is turned on and the file was written with the option \fI{extended_info, [md5sum]}\fR\&, reading the file is slower and consumes radically more CPU time than otherwise\&.
.LP
\fI{verify,false}\fR\& is the default\&.

Pseudo function that by means of a \fIparse_transform\fR\& translates \fILiteralFun\fR\& typed as parameter in the function call to a \fBmatch_spec\fR\&\&. With "literal" is meant that the fun needs to textually be written as the parameter of the function, it cannot be held in a variable which in turn is passed to the function)\&.
.LP
The parse transform is implemented in the module \fIms_transform\fR\& and the source \fImust\fR\& include the file \fIms_transform\&.hrl\fR\& in STDLIB for this pseudo function to work\&. Failing to include the hrl file in the source will result in a runtime error, not a compile time ditto\&. The include file is easiest included by adding the line \fI-include_lib("stdlib/include/ms_transform\&.hrl")\&.\fR\& to the source file\&.
.LP
The fun is very restricted, it can take only a single parameter (the object to match): a sole variable or a tuple\&. It needs to use the \fIis_\fR\&XXX guard tests\&. Language constructs that have no representation in a match_spec (like \fIif\fR\&, \fIcase\fR\&, \fIreceive\fR\& etc) are not allowed\&.
.LP
The return value is the resulting match_spec\&.
.LP
Example:
.LP
.nf

1> ets:fun2ms(fun({M,N}) when N > 3 -> M end)\&.
[{{'$1','$2'},[{'>','$2',3}],['$1']}]
.fi
.LP
Variables from the environment can be imported, so that this works:
.LP
.nf

2> X=3\&.
3
3> ets:fun2ms(fun({M,N}) when N > X -> M end)\&.
[{{'$1','$2'},[{'>','$2',{const,3}}],['$1']}]
.fi
.LP
The imported variables will be replaced by match_spec \fIconst\fR\& expressions, which is consistent with the static scoping for Erlang funs\&. Local or global function calls can not be in the guard or body of the fun however\&. Calls to builtin match_spec functions of course is allowed:
.LP
.nf

4> ets:fun2ms(fun({M,N}) when N > X, is_atomm(M) -> M end)\&.
Error: fun containing local Erlang function calls
('is_atomm' called in guard) cannot be translated into match_spec
{error,transform_error}
5> ets:fun2ms(fun({M,N}) when N > X, is_atom(M) -> M end)\&.
[{{'$1','$2'},[{'>','$2',{const,3}},{is_atom,'$1'}],['$1']}]
.fi
.LP
As can be seen by the example, the function can be called from the shell too\&. The fun needs to be literally in the call when used from the shell as well\&. Other means than the parse_transform are used in the shell case, but more or less the same restrictions apply (the exception being records, as they are not handled by the shell)\&.
.LP

.RS -4
.B
Warning:
.RE
If the parse_transform is not applied to a module which calls this pseudo function, the call will fail in runtime (with a \fIbadarg\fR\&)\&. The module \fIets\fR\& actually exports a function with this name, but it should never really be called except for when using the function in the shell\&. If the \fIparse_transform\fR\& is properly applied by including the \fIms_transform\&.hrl\fR\& header file, compiled code will never call the function, but the function call is replaced by a literal match_spec\&.

Returns a list of all objects with the key \fIKey\fR\& in the table \fITab\fR\&\&.

In the case of \fIset, bag and duplicate_bag\fR\&, an object is returned only if the given key \fImatches\fR\& the key of the object in the table\&.

If the table is of type \fIset\fR\& or \fIordered_set\fR\&, the function returns either the empty list or a list with one element, as there cannot be more than one object with the same key\&.

This means that the match_spec is always a list of one or more tuples (of arity 3)\&. The tuples first element should be a pattern as described in the documentation of \fIets:match/2\fR\&\&. The second element of the tuple should be a list of 0 or more guard tests (described below)\&. The third element of the tuple should be a list containing a description of the value to actually return\&. In almost all normal cases the list contains exactly one term which fully describes the value to return for each object\&.
.LP
The return value is constructed using the "match variables" bound in the MatchHead or using the special match variables \fI\&'$_\&'\fR\& (the whole matching object) and \fI\&'$$\&'\fR\& (all match variables in a list), so that the following \fIets:match/2\fR\& expression:
.LP
.nf

ets:match(Tab,{'$1','$2','$3'})
.fi
.LP
is exactly equivalent to:
.LP
.nf

ets:select(Tab,[{{'$1','$2','$3'},[],['$$']}])
.fi
.LP
- and the following \fIets:match_object/2\fR\& call:
.LP
.nf

ets:match_object(Tab,{'$1','$2','$1'})
.fi
.LP
is exactly equivalent to
.LP
.nf

ets:select(Tab,[{{'$1','$2','$1'},[],['$_']}])
.fi
.LP
Composite terms can be constructed in the \fIResult\fR\& part either by simply writing a list, so that this code:
.LP
.nf

ets:select(Tab,[{{'$1','$2','$3'},[],['$$']}])
.fi
.LP
gives the same output as:
.LP
.nf

ets:select(Tab,[{{'$1','$2','$3'},[],[['$1','$2','$3']]}])
.fi
.LP
i\&.e\&. all the bound variables in the match head as a list\&. If tuples are to be constructed, one has to write a tuple of arity 1 with the single element in the tuple being the tuple one wants to construct (as an ordinary tuple could be mistaken for a \fIGuard\fR\&)\&. Therefore the following call:
.LP
.nf

ets:select(Tab,[{{'$1','$2','$1'},[],['$_']}])
.fi
.LP
gives the same output as:
.LP
.nf

ets:select(Tab,[{{'$1','$2','$1'},[],[{{'$1','$2','$3'}}]}])
.fi
.LP
- this syntax is equivalent to the syntax used in the trace patterns (see \fBdbg(3)\fR\&)\&.
.LP
The \fIGuard\fR\&s are constructed as tuples where the first element is the name of the test and the rest of the elements are the parameters of the test\&. To check for a specific type (say a list) of the element bound to the match variable \fI\&'$1\&'\fR\&, one would write the test as \fI{is_list, \&'$1\&'}\fR\&\&. If the test fails, the object in the table will not match and the next \fIMatchFunction\fR\& (if any) will be tried\&. Most guard tests present in Erlang can be used, but only the new versions prefixed \fIis_\fR\& are allowed (like \fIis_float\fR\&, \fIis_atom\fR\& etc)\&.
.LP
The \fIGuard\fR\& section can also contain logic and arithmetic operations, which are written with the same syntax as the guard tests (prefix notation), so that a guard test written in Erlang looking like this:
.LP
.nf

is_integer(X), is_integer(Y), X + Y < 4711
.fi
.LP
is expressed like this (X replaced with \&'$1\&' and Y with \&'$2\&'):
.LP
.nf

[{is_integer, '$1'}, {is_integer, '$2'}, {'<', {'+', '$1', '$2'}, 4711}]
.fi
.LP
On tables of the \fIordered_set\fR\& type, objects are visited in the same order as in a \fIfirst/next\fR\& traversal\&.

This function provides an efficient way to update one or more elements within an object, without the hassle of having to look up, update and write back the entire object\&.
.LP
It will destructively update the object with key \fIKey\fR\& in the table \fITab\fR\&\&. The element at the \fIPos\fR\&:th position will be given the value \fIValue\fR\&\&.
.LP
A list of \fI{Pos,Value}\fR\& can be supplied to update several elements within the same object\&. If the same position occurs more than one in the list, the last value in the list will be written\&. If the list is empty or the function fails, no updates will be done at all\&. The function is also atomic in the sense that other processes can never see any intermediate results\&.
.LP
The function returns \fItrue\fR\& if an object with the key \fIKey\fR\& was found, \fIfalse\fR\& otherwise\&.
.LP
The given Key is used to identify the object by either \fImatching\fR\& the key of an object in a \fIset\fR\& table, or \fIcompare equal\fR\& to the key of an object in an \fIordered_set\fR\& table (see \fBlookup/2\fR\& and \fBnew/2\fR\& for details on the difference)\&.
.LP
The function will fail with reason \fIbadarg\fR\& if:
