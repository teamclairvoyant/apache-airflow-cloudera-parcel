Reason = term()
.br
The reason why the test case failed\&.
.br
.RE
.RS
.LP
This will make the test suite fail with a given reason, or with \fIsuite_failed\fR\& if no reason was given\&. Use this function if you want to terminate a test case, as this will make it easier to read the log- and HTML files\&. \fIReason\fR\& will appear in the comment field in the HTML log\&.

timetrap(Timout) -> Handle
.br
.RS
.TP 3
Types:

Timeout = integer() | {hours,H} | {minutes,M} | {seconds,S}
.br
H = M = S = integer()
.br
Pid = pid()
.br
The process that is to be timetrapped (\fIself()\fR\&by default)
.br
.RE
.RS
.LP
Sets up a time trap for the current process\&. An expired timetrap kills the process with reason \fItimetrap_timeout\fR\&\&. The returned handle is to be given as argument to \fItimetrap_cancel\fR\& before the timetrap expires\&. If \fITimeout\fR\& is an integer, it is expected to be milliseconds\&.
.LP

.RS -4
.B
Note:
.RE
If the current process is trapping exits, it will not be killed by the exit signal with reason \fItimetrap_timeout\fR\&\&. If this happens, the process will be sent an exit signal with reason \fIkill\fR\& 10 seconds later which will kill the process\&. Information about the timetrap timeout will in this case not be found in the test logs\&. However, the error_logger will be sent a warning\&.

.RE

.RS
.TP 3
Types:

Handle = term()

timetrap_scale_factor() -> ScaleFactor
.br
.RS
.TP 3
Types:

ScaleFactor = integer()
.br
.RE
.RS
.LP
This function returns the scale factor by which all timetraps are scaled\&. It is normally 1, but can be greater than 1 if the test_server is running \fIcover\fR\&, using a larger amount of scheduler threads than the amount of logical processors on the system, running under purify, valgrind or in a debug-compiled emulator\&. The scale factor can be used if you need to scale you own timeouts in test cases with same factor as the test_server uses\&.
.RE
.LP
.B
sleep(MSecs) -> ok
.br
.RS
.TP 3
Types:

MSecs = integer() | float() | infinity
.br
The number of milliseconds to sleep
.br
.RE
.RS
.LP
This function suspends the calling process for at least the supplied number of milliseconds\&. There are two major reasons why you should use this function instead of \fItimer:sleep\fR\&, the first being that the module \fItimer\fR\& may be unavailable at the time the test suite is run, and the second that it also accepts floating point numbers\&.
.RE
.LP
.B
adjusted_sleep(MSecs) -> ok
.br
.RS
.TP 3
Types:

MSecs = integer() | float() | infinity
.br
The default number of milliseconds to sleep
.br
.RE
.RS
.LP
This function suspends the calling process for at least the supplied number of milliseconds\&. The function behaves the same way as \fItest_server:sleep/1\fR\&, only \fIMSecs\fR\& will be multiplied by the \&'multiply_timetraps\&' value, if set, and also automatically scaled up if \&'scale_timetraps\&' is set to true (which it is by default)\&.

List of arguments to format\&.
.br
.RE
.RS
.LP
Formats output just like \fIio:format\fR\& but sends the formatted string to a logfile\&. If the urgency value, \fIPri\fR\&, is lower than some threshold value, it will also be written to the test person\&'s console\&. Default urgency is 50, default threshold for display on the console is 1\&.
.LP
Typically, the test person don\&'t want to see everything a test suite outputs, but is merely interested in if the test cases succeeded or not, which the test server tells him\&. If he would like to see more, he could manually change the threshold values by using the \fItest_server_ctrl:set_levels/3\fR\& function\&.

.LP
This function will cancel all timetraps and pause the execution of the test case until the user executes the \fIcontinue/0\fR\& function\&. It gives the user the opportunity to interact with the erlang node running the tests, e\&.g\&. for debugging purposes or for manually executing a part of the test case\&.

\fIFun\fR\& is executed in a process on a temporarily created hidden node with a proxy for communication with the test server node\&. The node is called a shielded node (should have been called a shield node)\&. If \fIFun\fR\& is successfully executed, the result is returned\&. A peer node (see \fIstart_node/3\fR\&) started from the shielded node will be shielded from test server node, i\&.e\&. they will not be aware of each other\&. This is useful when you want to start nodes from earlier OTP releases than the OTP release of the test server node\&.
.LP
Nodes from an earlier OTP release can normally not be started if the test server hasn\&'t been started in compatibility mode (see the \fI+R\fR\& flag in the \fIerl(1)\fR\& documentation) of an earlier release\&. If a shielded node is started in compatibility mode of an earlier OTP release than the OTP release of the test server node, the shielded node can start nodes of an earlier OTP release\&.

This functions starts a node, possibly on a remote machine, and guarantees cross architecture transparency\&. Type is set to either \fIslave\fR\& or \fIpeer\fR\&\&.
.LP
\fIslave\fR\& means that the new node will have a master, i\&.e\&. the slave node will terminate if the master terminates, TTY output produced on the slave will be sent back to the master node and file I/O is done via the master\&. The master is normally the target node unless the target is itself a slave\&.
.LP
\fIpeer\fR\& means that the new node is an independent node with no master\&.
.LP
\fIOptions\fR\& is a tuplelist which can contain one or more of
.RS 2
.TP 2
.B
\fI{remote, true}\fR\&:
Start the node on a remote host\&. If not specified, the node will be started on the local host (with some exceptions, as for the case of VxWorks, where all nodes are started on a remote host)\&. Test cases that require a remote host will fail with a reasonable comment if no remote hosts are available at the time they are run\&. 
.TP 2
.B
\fI{args, Arguments}\fR\&:
Arguments passed directly to the node\&. This is typically a string appended to the command line\&. 
.TP 2
.B
\fI{wait, false}\fR\&:
Don\&'t wait until the node is up\&. By default, this function does not return until the node is up and running, but this option makes it return as soon as the node start command is given\&.\&. 
.br
 Only valid for peer nodes 
.TP 2
.B
\fI{fail_on_error, false}\fR\&:
Returns \fI{error, Reason}\fR\& rather than failing the test case\&. 
.br
 Only valid for peer nodes\&. Note that slave nodes always act as if they had \fIfail_on_error=false\fR\&
.TP 2
.B
\fI{erl, ReleaseList}\fR\&:
Use an Erlang emulator determined by ReleaseList when starting nodes, instead of the same emulator as the test server is running\&. ReleaseList is a list of specifiers, where a specifier is either {release, Rel}, {prog, Prog}, or \&'this\&'\&. Rel is either the name of a release, e\&.g\&., "r12b_patched" or \&'latest\&'\&. \&'this\&' means using the same emulator as the test server\&. Prog is the name of an emulator executable\&. If the list has more than one element, one of them is picked randomly\&. (Only works on Solaris and Linux, and the test server gives warnings when it notices that nodes are not of the same version as itself\&.) 
.br

.br
 When specifying this option to run a previous release, use \fIis_release_available/1\fR\& function to test if the given release is available and skip the test case if not\&. 
.br

.br
 In order to avoid compatibility problems (may not appear right away), use a shielded node (see \fIrun_on_shielded_node/2\fR\&) when starting nodes from different OTP releases than the test server\&. 
.TP 2
.B
\fI{cleanup, false}\fR\&:
Tells the test server not to kill this node if it is still alive after the test case is completed\&. This is useful if the same node is to be used by a group of test cases\&. 
.TP 2
.B
\fI{env, Env}\fR\&:
\fIEnv\fR\& should be a list of tuples \fI{Name, Val}\fR\&, where \fIName\fR\& is the name of an environment variable, and \fIVal\fR\& is the value it is to have in the started node\&. Both \fIName\fR\& and \fIVal\fR\& must be strings\&. The one exception is \fIVal\fR\& being the atom \fIfalse\fR\& (in analogy with \fIos:getenv/1\fR\&), which removes the environment variable\&. Only valid for peer nodes\&. Not available on VxWorks\&.

The \fIline\fR\& macro is described under TEST SUITE SUPPORT MACROS below\&. The \fIline\fR\& macro will only report the last line executed when a test case failed\&.
.LP
The \fItest_server_line\fR\& parse transform is activated by including the headerfile \fItest_server_line\&.hrl\fR\& in the test suite\&. When doing this, it is important that the \fItest_server_line\fR\& module is in the code path of the erlang node compiling the test suite\&. The parse transform will report a history of a maximum of 10 lines when a test case fails\&. Consecutive lines in the same function are not shown\&.
.LP
The attribute \fI-no_lines(FuncList)\&.\fR\& can be used in the test suite to exclude specific functions from the parse transform\&. This is necessary e\&.g\&. for functions that are executed on old (i\&.e\&. <R10B) OTP releases\&. \fIFuncList = [{Func,Arity}]\fR\&\&.
.LP
If both the \fIline\fR\& macro and the parse transform is used in the same module, the parse transform will overrule the macro\&.

.LP
There are some macros defined in the \fItest_server\&.hrl\fR\& that are quite useful for test suite programmers:
.LP
The \fIline\fR\& macro, is quite essential when writing test cases\&. It tells the test server exactly what line of code that is being executed, so that it can report this line back if the test case fails\&. Use this macro at the beginning of every test case line of code\&.
.LP
The \fIconfig\fR\& macro, is used to retrieve information from the \fIConfig\fR\& variable sent to all test cases\&. It is used with two arguments, where the first is the name of the configuration variable you wish to retrieve, and the second is the \fIConfig\fR\& variable supplied to the test case from the test server\&.
.LP
Possible configuration variables include:
.RS 2
.TP 2
*
\fIdata_dir\fR\& - Data file directory\&.
.LP
.TP 2
*
\fIpriv_dir\fR\& - Scratch file directory\&.
.LP
.TP 2
*
\fInodes\fR\& - Nodes specified in the spec file
.LP
.TP 2
*
\fInodenames\fR\& - Generated nodenames\&.
.LP
.TP 2
*
Whatever added by conf test cases or \fIinit_per_testcase/2\fR\&

.LP
Examples of the \fIline\fR\& and \fIconfig\fR\& macros can be seen in the Examples chapter in the user\&'s guide\&.
.LP
If the \fIline_trace\fR\& macro is defined, you will get a timestamp (\fIerlang:now()\fR\&) in your minor log for each \fIline\fR\& macro in your suite\&. This way you can at any time see which line is currently being executed, and when the line was called\&.
.LP
The \fIline_trace\fR\& macro can also be used together with the \fItest_server_line\fR\& parse transform described above\&. A timestamp will then be written for each line in the suite, except for functions stated in the \fI-no_lines\fR\& attribute\&.
.LP
The \fIline_trace\fR\& macro can e\&.g\&. be defined as a compile option, like this: 
.br
\fIerlc -W -Dline_trace my_SUITE\&.erl\fR\&
