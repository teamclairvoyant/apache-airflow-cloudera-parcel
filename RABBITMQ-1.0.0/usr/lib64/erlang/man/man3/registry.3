.SH NAME
registry \- Store and backup key-value pairs
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
This module provides support for storing key-value pairs in a table known as a registry, backing up registries to Mnesia in an atomic manner, and later restoring the contents of a registry from Mnesia\&.

Open (create) a registry\&. The registry will be initially empty\&. Use \fIei_reg_close()\fR\& to close the registry later\&.
.LP
\fIsize\fR\& is the approximate number of objects you intend to store in the registry\&. Since the registry uses a hash table with collision chaining, there is no absolute upper limit on the number of objects that can be stored in it\&. However for reasons of efficiency, it is a good idea to choose a number that is appropriate for your needs\&. It is possible to use \fIei_reg_resize()\fR\& to change the size later\&. Note that the number you provide will be increased to the nearest larger prime number\&.
.LP
On success, an empty registry will be returned\&. On failure, NULL will be returned\&.

\fIflags\fR\& indicates the type of object that you are looking for\&. If \fIflags\fR\& is 0, then any kind of object will be returned\&. If \fIflags\fR\& is one of EI_INT, EI_FLT, EI_STR or EI_BIN, then only values of that kind will be returned\&.

If the function succeeds, \fIv\fR\& (and \fIsize\fR\& if the object is binary) will be initialized with the value associated with \fIkey\fR\&, and the function will return one of EI_INT, EI_FLT, EI_STR or EI_BIN, indicating the type of object\&.

Mark a registry object as dirty\&. This will ensure that it is included in the next backup to Mnesia\&. Normally this operation will not be necessary since all of the normal registry \&'set\&' functions do this automatically\&. However if you have retrieved the value of a string or binary object from the registry and modified the contents, then the change will be invisible to the registry and the object will be assumed to be unmodified\&. This function allows you to make such modifications and then let the registry know about them\&.

\fIreg\fR\& is the registry containing the object\&.

Dump the contents of a registry to a Mnesia table in an atomic manner, i\&.e\&. either all data will be updated, or none of it will\&. If any errors are encountered while backing up the data, the entire operation is aborted\&.

\fIfd\fR\& is an open connection to Erlang\&. Mnesia 3\&.0 or later must be running on the Erlang node\&.
.LP
\fIreg\fR\& is the registry to back up\&.
.LP
\fImntab\fR\& is the name of the Mnesia table where the backed up data should be placed\&. If the table does not exist, it will be created automatically using configurable defaults\&. See your Mnesia documentation for information about configuring this behaviour\&.
.LP
If \fIflags\fR\& is 0, the backup will include only those objects which have been created, modified or deleted since the last backup or restore (i\&.e\&. an incremental backup)\&. After the backup, any objects that were marked dirty are now clean, and any objects that had been marked for deletion are deleted\&.
.LP
Alternatively, setting flags to EI_FORCE will cause a full backup to be done, and EI_NOPURGE will cause the deleted objects to be left in the registry afterwards\&. These can be bitwise ORed together if both behaviours are desired\&. If EI_NOPURGE was specified, you can use \fIei_reg_purge()\fR\& to explicitly remove the deleted items from the registry later\&.

Note that only tables of a certain format can be restored, i\&.e\&. those that have been created and backed up to with \fIei_reg_dump()\fR\&\&. If the registry was not empty before the operation, then the contents of the table are added to the contents of the registry\&. If the table contains objects with the same keys as those already in the registry, the registry objects will be overwritten with the new values\&. If the registry contains objects that were not in the table, they will be unchanged by this operation\&.

After the restore operation, the entire contents of the registry is marked as unmodified\&. Note that this includes any objects that were modified before the restore and not overwritten by the restore\&.
