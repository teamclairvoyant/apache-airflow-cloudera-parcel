.LP
A NIF library contains native implementation of some functions of an Erlang module\&. The native implemented functions (NIFs) are called like any other functions without any difference to the caller\&. Each NIF must also have an implementation in Erlang that will be invoked if the function is called before the NIF library has been successfully loaded\&. A typical such stub implementation is to throw an exception\&. But it can also be used as a fallback implementation if the NIF library is not implemented for some architecture\&.
.LP
A minimal example of a NIF library can look like this:
.LP

.LP
.nf

/* niftest.c */
#include "erl_nif.h"

static ERL_NIF_TERM hello(ErlNifEnv* env, int argc, const ERL_NIF_TERM argv[])
{
    return enif_make_string(env, "Hello world!", ERL_NIF_LATIN1);
}

static ErlNifFunc nif_funcs[] =
{
    {"hello", 0, hello}
};

ERL_NIF_INIT(niftest,nif_funcs,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL)

.fi
.LP
and the Erlang module would have to look something like this:
.LP

.LP
.nf

-module(niftest).

-export([init/0, hello/0]).

init() ->
      erlang:load_nif("./niftest", 0).

hello() ->
      "NIF library not loaded".

.fi
.LP
and compile and test something like this (on Linux):
.LP

.LP
.nf

$> gcc -fPIC -shared -o niftest.so niftest.c -I $ERL_ROOT/usr/include/
$> erl

1> c(niftest).
{ok,niftest}
2> niftest:hello().
"NIF library not loaded"
3> niftest:init().
ok
4> niftest:hello().
"Hello world!"

.fi
.LP
A better solution for a real module is to take advantage of the new directive \fBon_load\fR\& to automatically load the NIF library when the module is loaded\&.
.LP

.RS -4
.B
Note:
.RE
A NIF does not have to be exported, it can be local to the module\&. Note however that unused local stub functions will be optimized away by the compiler causing loading of the NIF library to fail\&.

.LP
A loaded NIF library is tied to the Erlang module code version that loaded it\&. If the module is upgraded with a new version, the new Erlang code will have to load its own NIF library (or maybe choose not to)\&. The new code version can however choose to load the exact same NIF library as the old code if it wants to\&. Sharing the same dynamic library will mean that static data defined by the library will be shared as well\&. To avoid unintentionally shared static data, each Erlang module code can keep its own private data\&. This private data can be set when the NIF library is loaded and then retrieved by calling \fBenif_priv_data\fR\&\&.
.LP
There is no way to explicitly unload a NIF library\&. A library will be automatically unloaded when the module code that it belongs to is purged by the code server\&. A NIF library will also be unloaded if it is replaced by another version of the library by a second call to \fIerlang:load_nif/2\fR\& from the same module code\&.
.SH "FUNCTIONALITY"

.LP
All functions that a NIF library needs to do with Erlang are performed through the NIF API functions\&. There are functions for the following functionality:
.RS 2
.TP 2
.B
Read and write Erlang terms:
Any Erlang terms can be passed to a NIF as function arguments and be returned as function return values\&. The terms are of C-type \fBERL_NIF_TERM\fR\& and can only be read or written using API functions\&. Most functions to read the content of a term are prefixed \fIenif_get_\fR\& and usually return true (or false) if the term was of the expected type (or not)\&. The functions to write terms are all prefixed \fIenif_make_\fR\& and usually return the created \fIERL_NIF_TERM\fR\&\&. There are also some functions to query terms, like \fIenif_is_atom\fR\&, \fIenif_is_identical\fR\& and \fIenif_compare\fR\&\&.
.RS 2
.LP
All terms of type \fIERL_NIF_TERM\fR\& belong to an environment of type \fBErlNifEnv\fR\&\&. The lifetime of a term is controlled by the lifetime of its environment object\&. All API functions that read or write terms has the environment, that the term belongs to, as the first function argument\&.
.RE
.TP 2
.B
Binaries:
Terms of type binary are accessed with the help of the struct type \fBErlNifBinary\fR\& that contains a pointer (\fIdata\fR\&) to the raw binary data and the length (\fIsize\fR\&) of the data in bytes\&. Both \fIdata\fR\& and \fIsize\fR\& are read-only and should only be written using calls to API functions\&. Instances of \fIErlNifBinary\fR\& are however always allocated by the user (usually as local variables)\&.
.RS 2
.LP
The raw data pointed to by \fIdata\fR\& is only mutable after a call to \fBenif_alloc_binary\fR\& or \fBenif_realloc_binary\fR\&\&. All other functions that operates on a binary will leave the data as read-only\&. A mutable binary must in the end either be freed with \fBenif_release_binary\fR\& or made read-only by transferring it to an Erlang term with \fBenif_make_binary\fR\&\&. But it does not have to happen in the same NIF call\&. Read-only binaries do not have to be released\&.
.RE
.RS 2
.LP
\fBenif_make_new_binary\fR\& can be used as a shortcut to allocate and return a binary in the same NIF call\&.
.RE
.RS 2
.LP
Binaries are sequences of whole bytes\&. Bitstrings with an arbitrary bit length have no support yet\&.
.RE
.TP 2
.B
Resource objects:
The use of resource objects is a way to return pointers to native data structures from a NIF in a safe way\&. A resource object is just a block of memory allocated with \fBenif_alloc_resource\fR\&\&. A handle ("safe pointer") to this memory block can then be returned to Erlang by the use of \fBenif_make_resource\fR\&\&. The term returned by \fIenif_make_resource\fR\& is totally opaque in nature\&. It can be stored and passed between processes on the same node, but the only real end usage is to pass it back as an argument to a NIF\&. The NIF can then call \fBenif_get_resource\fR\& and get back a pointer to the memory block that is guaranteed to still be valid\&. A resource object will not be deallocated until the last handle term has been garbage collected by the VM and the resource has been released with \fBenif_release_resource\fR\& (not necessarily in that order)\&.
.RS 2
.LP
All resource objects are created as instances of some \fIresource type\fR\&\&. This makes resources from different modules to be distinguishable\&. A resource type is created by calling \fBenif_open_resource_type\fR\& when a library is loaded\&. Objects of that resource type can then later be allocated and \fIenif_get_resource\fR\& verifies that the resource is of the expected type\&. A resource type can have a user supplied destructor function that is automatically called when resources of that type are released (by either the garbage collector or \fIenif_release_resource\fR\&)\&. Resource types are uniquely identified by a supplied name string and the name of the implementing module\&.
.RE
.RS 2
.LP
Here is a template example of how to create and return a resource object\&.
.RE
.RS 2
.LP

.RE
.LP
.nf

    ERL_NIF_TERM term;
    MyStruct* obj = enif_alloc_resource(my_resource_type, sizeof(MyStruct));

    /* initialize struct ... */

    term = enif_make_resource(env, obj);

    if (keep_a_reference_of_our_own) {
        /* store 'obj' in static variable, private data or other resource object */
    }
    else {
        enif_release_resource(obj);
        /* resource now only owned by "Erlang" */
    }
    return term;
    
.fi
.RS 2
.LP
Note that once \fIenif_make_resource\fR\& creates the term to return to Erlang, the code can choose to either keep its own native pointer to the allocated struct and release it later, or release it immediately and rely solely on the garbage collector to eventually deallocate the resource object when it collects the term\&.
.RE
.RS 2
.LP
Another usage of resource objects is to create binary terms with user defined memory management\&. \fBenif_make_resource_binary\fR\& will create a binary term that is connected to a resource object\&. The destructor of the resource will be called when the binary is garbage collected, at which time the binary data can be released\&. An example of this can be a binary term consisting of data from a \fImmap\fR\&\&'ed file\&. The destructor can then do \fImunmap\fR\& to release the memory region\&.
.RE
.RS 2
.LP
Resource types support upgrade in runtime by allowing a loaded NIF library to takeover an already existing resource type and thereby "inherit" all existing objects of that type\&. The destructor of the new library will thereafter be called for the inherited objects and the library with the old destructor function can be safely unloaded\&. Existing resource objects, of a module that is upgraded, must either be deleted or taken over by the new NIF library\&. The unloading of a library will be postponed as long as there exist resource objects with a destructor function in the library\&.
.RE
.TP 2
.B
Threads and concurrency:
A NIF is thread-safe without any explicit synchronization as long as it acts as a pure function and only reads the supplied arguments\&. As soon as you write towards a shared state either through static variables or \fBenif_priv_data\fR\& you need to supply your own explicit synchronization\&. This includes terms in process independent environments that are shared between threads\&. Resource objects will also require synchronization if you treat them as mutable\&.
.RS 2
.LP
The library initialization callbacks \fIload\fR\&, \fIreload\fR\& and \fIupgrade\fR\& are all thread-safe even for shared state data\&.
.RE
.RS 2
.LP
Avoid doing lengthy work in NIF calls as that may degrade the responsiveness of the VM\&. NIFs are called directly by the same scheduler thread that executed the calling Erlang code\&. The calling scheduler will thus be blocked from doing any other work until the NIF returns\&.

.RS 2
.LP
Works the same as \fIload\fR\&\&. The only difference is that \fI*old_priv_data\fR\& already contains the value set by the last call to \fIload\fR\& or \fIreload\fR\& for the old module code\&. \fI*priv_data\fR\& will be initialized to NULL when \fIupgrade\fR\& is called\&. It is allowed to write to both *priv_data and *old_priv_data\&.

\fIunload\fR\& is called when the module code that the NIF library belongs to is purged as old\&. New code of the same module may or may not exist\&. Note that \fIunload\fR\& is not called for a replaced library as a consequence of \fIreload\fR\&\&.

ERL_NIF_TERM:
Variables of type \fIERL_NIF_TERM\fR\& can refer to any Erlang term\&. This is an opaque type and values of it can only by used either as arguments to API functions or as return values from NIFs\&. All \fIERL_NIF_TERM\fR\&\&'s belong to an environment (\fBErlNifEnv\fR\&)\&. A term can not be destructed individually, it is valid until its environment is destructed\&.
.TP 2
.B
ErlNifEnv:
\fIErlNifEnv\fR\& represents an environment that can host Erlang terms\&. All terms in an environment are valid as long as the environment is valid\&. \fIErlNifEnv\fR\& is an opaque type and pointers to it can only be passed on to API functions\&. There are two types of environments; process bound and process independent\&.
.RS 2
.LP
A \fIprocess bound environment\fR\& is passed as the first argument to all NIFs\&. All function arguments passed to a NIF will belong to that environment\&. The return value from a NIF must also be a term belonging to the same environment\&. In addition a process bound environment contains transient information about the calling Erlang process\&. The environment is only valid in the thread where it was supplied as argument until the NIF returns\&. It is thus useless and dangerous to store pointers to process bound environments between NIF calls\&.
.RE
.RS 2

A \fIprocess independent environment\fR\& is created by calling \fBenif_alloc_env\fR\&\&. It can be used to store terms between NIF calls and to send terms with \fBenif_send\fR\&\&.
