.SH NAME
xref \- A Cross Reference Tool for analyzing dependencies between functions, modules, applications and releases.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
Xref is a cross reference tool that can be used for finding dependencies between functions, modules, applications and releases\&.
.LP
Calls between functions are either \fIlocal calls\fR\& like \fIf()\fR\&, or \fIexternal calls\fR\& like \fIm:f()\fR\&\&. \fIModule data\fR\&, which are extracted from BEAM files, include local functions, exported functions, local calls and external calls\&. By default, calls to built-in functions () are ignored, but if the option \fIbuiltins\fR\&, accepted by some of this module\&'s functions, is set to \fItrue\fR\&, calls to BIFs are included as well\&. It is the analyzing OTP version that decides what functions are BIFs\&. Functional objects are assumed to be called where they are created (and nowhere else)\&. \fIUnresolved calls\fR\& are calls to \fIapply\fR\& or \fIspawn\fR\& with variable module, variable function, or variable arguments\&. Examples are \fIM:F(a)\fR\&, \fIapply(M, f, [a])\fR\&, and \fIspawn(m, f(), Args)\fR\&\&. Unresolved calls are represented by calls where variable modules have been replaced with the atom \fI\&'$M_EXPR\&'\fR\&, variable functions have been replaced with the atom \fI\&'$F_EXPR\&'\fR\&, and variable number of arguments have been replaced with the number \fI-1\fR\&\&. The above mentioned examples are represented by calls to \fI\&'$M_EXPR\&':\&'$F_EXPR\&'/1\fR\&, \fI\&'$M_EXPR\&':f/1\fR\&, and \fIm:\&'$F_EXPR\&'/-1\fR\&\&. The unresolved calls are a subset of the external calls\&.

Warning:
.RE
Unresolved calls make module data incomplete, which implies that the results of analyses may be invalid\&.

.LP
\fIApplications\fR\& are collections of modules\&. The modules\&' BEAM files are located in the \fIebin\fR\& subdirectory of the application directory\&. The name of the application directory determines the name and version of the application\&. \fIReleases\fR\& are collections of applications located in the \fIlib\fR\& subdirectory of the release directory\&. There is more to read about applications and releases in the Design Principles book\&.
.LP
\fIXref servers\fR\& are identified by names, supplied when creating new servers\&. Each Xref server holds a set of releases, a set of applications, and a set of modules with module data\&. Xref servers are independent of each other, and all analyses are evaluated in the context of one single Xref server (exceptions are the functions \fIm/1\fR\& and \fId/1\fR\& which do not use servers at all)\&. The \fImode\fR\& of an Xref server determines what module data are extracted from BEAM files as modules are added to the server\&. Starting with R7, BEAM files compiled with the option \fIdebug_info\fR\& contain so called debug information, which is an abstract representation of the code\&. In \fIfunctions\fR\& mode, which is the default mode, function calls and line numbers are extracted from debug information\&. In \fImodules\fR\& mode, debug information is ignored if present, but dependencies between modules are extracted from other parts of the BEAM files\&. The \fImodules\fR\& mode is significantly less time and space consuming than the \fIfunctions\fR\& mode, but the analyses that can be done are limited\&.
.LP
An \fIanalyzed module\fR\& is a module that has been added to an Xref server together with its module data\&. A \fIlibrary module\fR\& is a module located in some directory mentioned in the \fIlibrary path\fR\&\&. A library module is said to be used if some of its exported functions are used by some analyzed module\&. An \fIunknown module\fR\& is a module that is neither an analyzed module nor a library module, but whose exported functions are used by some analyzed module\&. An \fIunknown function\fR\& is a used function that is neither local or exported by any analyzed module nor exported by any library module\&. An \fIundefined function\fR\& is an externally used function that is not exported by any analyzed module or library module\&. With this notion, a local function can be an undefined function, namely if it is externally used from some module\&. All unknown functions are also undefined functions; there is a \fBfigure\fR\& in the User\&'s Guide that illustrates this relationship\&.
.LP
Starting with R9C, the module attribute tag \fIdeprecated\fR\& can be used to inform Xref about \fIdeprecated functions\fR\& and optionally when functions are planned to be removed\&. A few examples show the idea:
.RS 2

.LP
Before any analysis can take place, module data must be \fIset up\fR\&\&. For instance, the cross reference and the unknown functions are computed when all module data are known\&. The functions that need complete data (\fIanalyze\fR\&, \fIq\fR\&, \fIvariables\fR\&) take care of setting up data automatically\&. Module data need to be set up (again) after calls to any of the \fIadd\fR\&, \fIreplace\fR\&, \fIremove\fR\&, \fIset_library_path\fR\& or \fIupdate\fR\& functions\&.
.LP
The result of setting up module data is the \fICall Graph\fR\&\&. A (directed) graph consists of a set of vertices and a set of (directed) edges\&. The edges represent \fIcalls\fR\& (From, To) between functions, modules, applications or releases\&. From is said to call To, and To is said to be used by From\&. The vertices of the Call Graph are the functions of all module data: local and exported functions of analyzed modules; used BIFs; used exported functions of library modules; and unknown functions\&. The functions \fImodule_info/0,1\fR\& added by the compiler are included among the exported functions, but only when called from some module\&. The edges are the function calls of all module data\&. A consequence of the edges being a set is that there is only one edge if a function is locally or externally used several times on one and the same line of code\&.
.LP
The Call Graph is represented by Erlang terms (the sets are lists), which is suitable for many analyses\&. But for analyses that look at chains of calls, a list representation is much too slow\&. Instead the representation offered by the \fIdigraph\fR\& module is used\&. The translation of the list representation of the Call Graph - or a subgraph thereof - to the \fIdigraph\fR\& representation does not come for free, so the language used for expressing queries to be described below has a special operator for this task and a possibility to save the \fIdigraph\fR\& representation for subsequent analyses\&.
.LP
In addition to the Call Graph there is a graph called the \fIInter Call Graph\fR\&\&. This is a graph of calls (From, To) such that there is a chain of calls from From to To in the Call Graph, and every From and To is an exported function or an unused local function\&. The vertices are the same as for the Call Graph\&.
.LP
Calls between modules, applications and releases are also directed graphs\&. The \fItypes\fR\& of the vertices and edges of these graphs are (ranging from the most special to the most general): \fIFun\fR\& for functions; \fIMod\fR\& for modules; \fIApp\fR\& for applications; and \fIRel\fR\& for releases\&. The following paragraphs will describe the different constructs of the language used for selecting and analyzing parts of the graphs, beginning with the \fIconstants\fR\&:

Examples of constants are: \fIkernel\fR\&, \fIkernel->stdlib\fR\&, \fI[kernel, sasl]\fR\&, \fI[pg -> mnesia, {tv, mnesia}] : Mod\fR\&\&. It is an error if an instance of \fIConst\fR\& does not match any vertex of any graph\&. If there are more than one vertex matching an untyped instance of \fIAtomConst\fR\&, then the one of the most general type is chosen\&. A list of constants is interpreted as a set of constants, all of the same type\&. A tuple of constants constitute a chain of calls (which may, but does not have to, correspond to an actual chain of calls of some graph)\&. Assigning a type to a list or tuple of \fIConstant\fR\& is equivalent to assigning the type to each \fIConstant\fR\&\&.
.LP
\fIRegular expressions\fR\& are used as a means to select some of the vertices of a graph\&. A \fIRegExpr\fR\& consisting of a \fIRegString\fR\& and a type - an example is \fI"xref_\&.*" : Mod\fR\& - is interpreted as those modules (or applications or releases, depending on the type) that match the expression\&. Similarly, a \fIRegFunc\fR\& is interpreted as those vertices of the Call Graph that match the expression\&. An example is \fI"xref_\&.*":"add_\&.*"/"(2|3)"\fR\&, which matches all \fIadd\fR\& functions of arity two or three of any of the xref modules\&. Another example, one that matches all functions of arity 10 or more: \fI_:_/"[1-9]\&.+"\fR\&\&. Here \fI_\fR\& is an abbreviation for \fI"\&.*"\fR\&, that is, the regular expression that matches anything\&.

There are two kinds of variables: predefined variables and user variables\&. \fIPredefined variables\fR\& hold set up module data, and cannot be assigned to but only used in queries\&. \fIUser variables\fR\& on the other hand can be assigned to, and are typically used for temporary results while evaluating a query, and for keeping results of queries for use in subsequent queries\&.

The interpretation of the cast operator depends on the named type \fIType\fR\&, the type of \fIExpression\fR\&, and the structure of the elements of the interpretation of \fIExpression\fR\&\&. If the named type is equal to the expression type, no conversion is done\&. Otherwise, the conversion is done one step at a time; \fI(Fun) (App) RE\fR\&, for instance, is equivalent to \fI(Fun) (Mod) (App) RE\fR\&\&. Now assume that the interpretation of \fIExpression\fR\& is a set of constants (functions, modules, applications or releases)\&. If the named type is more general than the expression type, say \fIMod\fR\& and \fIFun\fR\& respectively, then the interpretation of the cast expression is the set of modules that have at least one of their functions mentioned in the interpretation of the expression\&. If the named type is more special than the expression type, say \fIFun\fR\& and \fIMod\fR\&, then the interpretation is the set of all the functions of the modules (in \fImodules\fR\& mode, the conversion is partial since the local functions are not known)\&. The conversions to and from applications and releases work analogously\&. For instance, \fI(App) "xref_\&.*" : Mod\fR\& returns all applications containing at least one module such that \fIxref_\fR\& is a prefix of the module name\&.
.LP
Now assume that the interpretation of \fIExpression\fR\& is a set of calls\&. If the named type is more general than the expression type, say \fIMod\fR\& and \fIFun\fR\& respectively, then the interpretation of the cast expression is the set of calls (M1, M2) such that the interpretation of the expression contains a call from some function of M1 to some function of M2\&. If the named type is more special than the expression type, say \fIFun\fR\& and \fIMod\fR\&, then the interpretation is the set of all function calls (F1, F2) such that the interpretation of the expression contains a call (M1, M2) and F1 is a function of M1 and F2 is a function of M2 (in \fImodules\fR\& mode, there are no functions calls, so a cast to \fIFun\fR\& always yields an empty set)\&. Again, the conversions to and from applications and releases work analogously\&.

The interpretation of constants and variables are sets, and those sets can be used as the basis for forming new sets by the application of \fIset operators\fR\&\&. The syntax:

.LP
\fI+\fR\&, \fI*\fR\& and \fI-\fR\& are interpreted as union, intersection and difference respectively: the union of two sets contains the elements of both sets; the intersection of two sets contains the elements common to both sets; and the difference of two sets contains the elements of the first set that are not members of the second set\&. The elements of the two sets must be of the same structure; for instance, a function call cannot be combined with a function\&. But if a cast operator can make the elements compatible, then the more general elements are converted to the less general element type\&. For instance, \fIM + F\fR\& is equivalent to \fI(Fun) M + F\fR\&, and \fIE - AE\fR\& is equivalent to \fIE - (Fun) AE\fR\&\&. One more example: \fIX * xref : Mod\fR\& is interpreted as the set of functions exported by the module \fIxref\fR\&; \fIxref : Mod\fR\& is converted to the more special type of \fIX\fR\& (\fIFun\fR\&, that is) yielding all functions of \fIxref\fR\&, and the intersection with \fIX\fR\& (all functions exported by analyzed modules and library modules) is interpreted as those functions that are exported by some module \fIand\fR\& functions of \fIxref\fR\&\&.

Two functions (modules, applications, releases) belong to the same strongly connected component if they call each other (in)directly\&. The interpretation of the \fIcomponents\fR\& operator is the set of strongly connected components of a set of calls\&.

The interpretation of the \fIof\fR\& operator is a chain of calls of the second operand (a set of calls) that passes throw all of the vertices of the first operand (a tuple of constants), in the given order\&.

The restriction operators are defined for closures as well; \fIclosure E | xref : Mod\fR\& is interpreted as the direct or indirect function calls from the \fIxref\fR\& module, while the interpretation of \fIE | xref : Mod\fR\& is the set of direct calls from \fIxref\fR\&\&. If some graph is to be used in several graph analyses, it saves time to assign the \fIdigraph\fR\& representation of the graph to a user variable, and then make sure that every graph analysis operates on that variable instead of the list representation of the graph\&.

The lines where functions are defined (more precisely: where the first clause begins) and the lines where functions are used are available in \fIfunctions\fR\& mode\&.

The \fILin\fR\& (\fILLin\fR\&, \fIXLin\fR\&) operator assigns the lines where calls (local calls, external calls) are made\&. The \fIELin\fR\& operator assigns to each call (From, To), for which it is defined, every line L such that there is a chain of calls from From to To beginning with a call on line L\&.
.LP
The \fIXXL\fR\& operator is defined for the interpretation of any of the LineOp operators applied to a set of function calls\&. The result is that of replacing the function call with a line numbered function call, that is, each of the two functions of the call is replaced by a pair of the function and the line where the function is defined\&. The effect of the \fIXXL\fR\& operator can be undone by the LineOp operators\&. For instance, \fI(Lin) (XXL) (Lin) E\fR\& is equivalent to \fI(Lin) E\fR\&\&.

The \fI+\fR\&, \fI-\fR\&, \fI*\fR\& and \fI#\fR\& operators are defined for line number expressions, provided the operands are compatible\&.

Sets the \fBlibrary path\fR\&\&.

The library path \fIcode_path\fR\& is used by the functions \fIm/1\fR\& and \fId/1\fR\&, but can also be set explicitly\&. Note however that the code path will be traversed once for each used \fBlibrary module\fR\& while setting up module data\&. On the other hand, if there are only a few modules that are used by not analyzed, using \fIcode_path\fR\& may be faster than setting the library path to \fIcode:get_path()\fR\&\&.

If the library path is set to \fIcode_path\fR\&, the set of library modules is not determined, and the \fIinfo\fR\& functions will return empty lists of library modules\&.
