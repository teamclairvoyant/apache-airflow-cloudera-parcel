epmd \- Erlang Port Mapper Daemonepmd [-d|-debug] [DbgExtra...] [-port No] [-daemon] [-relaxed_command_check]Starts the port mapper daemonepmd [-d|-debug] [-port No] [-names|-kill|-stop Name]Communicates with a running port mapper daemon
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
This daemon acts as a name server on all hosts involved in distributed Erlang computations\&. When an Erlang node starts, the node has a name and it obtains an address from the host OS kernel\&. The name and the address are sent to the \fIepmd\fR\& daemon running on the local host\&. In a TCP/IP environment, the address consists of the IP address and a port number\&. The name of the node is an atom on the form of \fIName@Node\fR\&\&. The job of the \fIepmd\fR\& daemon is to keep track of which node name listens on which address\&. Hence, \fIepmd\fR\& map symbolic node names to machine addresses\&.
.LP
The TCP/IP \fIepmd\fR\& daemon actually only keeps track of the \fIName\fR\& (first) part of an Erlang node name, the \fIHost\fR\& part (whatever is after the \fI@\fR\& is implicit in the node name where the \fIepmd\fR\& daemon was actually contacted, as is the IP address where the Erlang node can be reached\&. Consistent and correct TCP naming services are therefore required for an Erlang network to function correctly\&.

Starting the port mapper daemon:
The daemon is started automatically by the \fIerl\fR\& command if the node is to be distributed and there is no running instance present\&. If automatically launched, environment variables has to be used to alter the behavior of the daemon\&. See the \fBEnvironment variables\fR\& section below\&.
.RS 2
.LP
If the -daemon argument is not given, the \fIepmd\fR\& runs as a normal program with the controlling terminal of the shell in which it is started\&. Normally, it should run as a daemon\&.

Communicating with a running port mapper daemon:
Communicating with the running epmd daemon by means of the \fIepmd\fR\& program is done primarily for debugging purposes\&.

.SH "REGULAR OPTIONS"

.LP
These options are available when starting the actual name server\&. The name server is normally started automatically by the \fIerl\fR\& command (if not already available), but it can also be started at i\&.e\&. system start-up\&.
.RS 2
.TP 2
.B
\fI-address List\fR\&:
Let this instance of \fIepmd\fR\& listen only on the comma-separated list of IP addresses and on the loopback address (which is implicitly added to the list if it has not been specified)\&. This can also be set using the \fIERL_EPMD_ADDRESS\fR\& environment variable, see the section \fBEnvironment variables\fR\& below\&.
.TP 2
.B
\fI-port No\fR\&:
Let this instance of epmd listen to another TCP port than default 4369\&. This can also be set using the \fIERL_EPMD_PORT\fR\& environment variable, see the section \fBEnvironment variables\fR\& below
.TP 2
.B
\fI-d | -debug\fR\&:
Enable debug output\&. The more \fI-d\fR\& flags given, the more debug output you will get (to a certain limit)\&. This option is most useful when the epmd daemon is not started as a daemon\&.
.TP 2
.B
\fI-daemon\fR\&:
Start epmd detached from the controlling terminal\&. Logging will end up in syslog when available and correctly configured\&. If the epmd daemon is started at boot, this option should definitely be used\&. It is also used when the \fIerl\fR\& command automatically starts \fIepmd\fR\&\&.
.TP 2
.B
\fI-relaxed_command_check\fR\&:
Start the epmd program with relaxed command checking (mostly for backward compatibility)\&. This affects the following:
.RS 2
.TP 2
*
With relaxed command checking, the \fIepmd\fR\& daemon can be killed from the localhost with i\&.e\&. \fIepmd -kill\fR\& even if there are active nodes registered\&. Normally only daemons with an empty node database can be killed with the \fIepmd -kill\fR\& command\&.
.LP
.TP 2
*
The \fIepmd -stop\fR\& command (and the corresponding messages to epmd, as can be given using \fIerl_interface/ei\fR\&) is normally always ignored, as it opens up for strange situation when two nodes of the same name can be alive at the same time\&. A node unregisters itself by just closing the connection to epmd, why the \fIstop\fR\& command was only intended for use in debugging situations\&.
.RS 2
.LP
With relaxed command checking enabled, you can forcibly unregister live nodes\&.

Relaxed command checking can also be enabled by setting the environment variable \fIERL_EPMD_RELAXED_COMMAND_CHECK\fR\& prior to starting \fIepmd\fR\&\&.

.SH "DBGEXTRA OPTIONS"

.LP
These options are purely for debugging and testing epmd clients, they should not be used in normal operation\&.
.RS 2
.TP 2
.B
\fI-packet_timeout Seconds\fR\&:
Set the number of seconds a connection can be inactive before epmd times out and closes the connection (default 60)\&.
.TP 2
.B
\fI-delay_accept Seconds\fR\&:
To simulate a busy server you can insert a delay between epmd gets notified about that a new connection is requested and when the connections gets accepted\&.
.TP 2
.B
\fI-delay_write Seconds\fR\&:
Also a simulation of a busy server\&. Inserts a delay before a reply is sent\&.
.RE
.SH "INTERACTIVE OPTIONS"

.LP
These options make \fIepmd\fR\& run as an interactive command displaying the results of sending queries ta an already running instance of \fIepmd\fR\&\&. The epmd contacted is always on the local node, but the \fI-port\fR\& option can be used to select between instances if several are running using different port on the host\&.
.RS 2
.TP 2
.B
\fI-port No\fR\&:
Contacts the \fIepmd\fR\& listening on the given TCP port number (default 4369)\&. This can also be set using the \fIERL_EPMD_PORT\fR\& environment variable, see the section \fBEnvironment variables\fR\& below
.TP 2
.B
\fI-names\fR\&:
List names registered with the currently running epmd
.TP 2
.B
\fI-kill\fR\&:
Kill the currently running \fIepmd\fR\&\&.
.RS 2
.LP
Killing the running \fIepmd\fR\& is only allowed if \fIepmd -names\fR\& show an empty database or \fI-relaxed_command_check\fR\& was given when the running instance of \fIepmd\fR\& was started\&. Note that \fI-relaxed_command_check\fR\& is given when starting the daemon that is to accept killing when it has live nodes registered\&. When running epmd interactively, \fI-relaxed_command_check\fR\& has no effect\&. A daemon that is started without relaxed command checking has to be killed using i\&.e\&. signals or some other OS specific method if it has active clients registered\&.
.RE
.TP 2
.B
\fI-stop Name\fR\&:
Forcibly unregister a live node from \fIepmd\fR\&\&'s database
.RS 2
.LP
This command can only be used when contacting \fIepmd\fR\& instances started with the \fI-relaxed_command_check\fR\& flag\&. Note that relaxed command checking has to be enabled for the \fIepmd\fR\& daemon contacted, When running epmd interactively, \fI-relaxed_command_check\fR\& has no effect\&.

.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"

.RS 2
.TP 2
.B
\fIERL_EPMD_ADDRESS\fR\&:
This environment variable may be set to a comma-separated list of IP addresses, in which case the \fIepmd\fR\& daemon will listen only on the specified address(es) and on the loopback address (which is implicitly added to the list if it has not been specified)\&. The default behaviour is to listen on all available IP addresses\&.
.TP 2
.B
\fIERL_EPMD_PORT\fR\&:
This environment variable can contain the port number epmd will use\&. The default port will work fine in most cases\&. A different port can be specified to allow several instances of epmd, representing independent clusters of nodes, to co-exist on the same host\&. All nodes in a cluster must use the same epmd port number\&.
.TP 2
.B
\fIERL_EPMD_RELAXED_COMMAND_CHECK\fR\&:
If set prior to start, the \fIepmd\fR\& daemon will behave as if the \fI-relaxed_command_check\fR\& option was given at start-up\&. If consequently setting this option before starting the Erlang virtual machine, the automatically started \fIepmd\fR\& will accept the \fI-kill\fR\& and \fI-stop\fR\& commands without restrictions\&.
.RE
.SH "LOGGING"

.LP
On some operating systems \fIsyslog\fR\& will be used for error reporting when epmd runs as an daemon\&. To enable the error logging you have to edit /etc/syslog\&.conf file and add an entry
.LP
.nf

      !epmd
      *.*<TABs>/var/log/epmd.log
    
.fi
.LP
where <TABs> are at least one real tab character\&. Spaces will silently be ignored\&.
.SH "ACCESS RESTRICTIONS"

.LP
The \fIepmd\fR\& daemon accepts messages from both localhost and remote hosts\&. However, only the query commands are answered (and acted upon) if the query comes from a remote host\&. It is always an error to try to register a nodename if the client is not a process located on the same host as the \fIepmd\fR\& instance is running on, why such requests are considered hostile and the connection is immediately closed\&.
.LP
The queries accepted from remote nodes are:
.RS 2
.TP 2
*
Port queries - i\&.e\&. on which port does the node with a given name listen
.LP
.TP 2
*
Name listing - i\&.e\&. give a list of all names registered on the host
.LP

To restrict access further, firewall software has to be used\&.
